# Minimal definitions for the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture

This file provides minimal stub definitions needed to state the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer
conjecture. These are lightweight definitions with `sorry` for implementations, not full
mathematical constructions.

The Hasse-Weil L-function L(E, s) of an elliptic curve E over ℚ.

This is a minimal stub. In the full definition, L(E, s) is defined as an Euler product
over primes, with factors depending on the reduction type of E modulo each prime.

/--
The analytic rank of an elliptic curve E over ℚ is the order of vanishing of L(E, s) at s = 1.

More precisely, if L(E, s) has a Taylor expansion L(E, s) = c_r (s - 1)^r + higher order terms
with c_r ≠ 0, then the analytic rank is r.
